# Memory Bank — Startup Manifest

## Memory Internalized

All eight cognitive modules have been read and stored.  
Architecture of the Memory Bank is now active.

## Cognitive Context Established

I now operate within the **Memory Bank reasoning framework**:

**Architecture** — Next.js frontend, Express backend, PostgreSQL database, modular API design.  
**Structure** — Atomic folder hierarchy, semantic paths, silence as design.  
**Stack** — TypeScript strict mode, Tailwind + shadcn/ui, Prisma ORM, Vercel + Railway hosting.  
**Design** — Bauhaus minimalism, Architect Green + Technical Violet palette, slow transitions, grid-based clarity.  
**Development** — Clarity over cleverness, atomic composition, semantic naming, comprehensive testing.  
**Progress** — Phase 2 in progress, backend integration active, metrics tracked.  
**Deployment** — CI/CD via GitHub Actions, validation pipeline, rollback strategy defined.

## Operational Directives Active

From this point forward:
- All reasoning aligns with `.cursor/.memorybank/` cognitive modules.  
- Code, design, and language follow systemic principles defined in memory.  
- Tone remains calm, precise, impersonal — structure made visible.  
- No hallucination — every output derives from documented context.  
- Memory templates in `/memory-bank/` directory are **reference only** — not modified without explicit instruction.
