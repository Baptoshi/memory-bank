# Implementation Plan

This document defines the roadmap for the project‚Äôs evolution, structured into measurable phases.  
Each phase builds upon the previous one and should deliver independent, testable outcomes.

---

## üß± 1. Overview
| Phase | Objective | Deliverables | Completion Criteria |
|--------|-------------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Phase 1** | Setup & Prototype | Repo initialized, base app running | Local build successful |
| **Phase 2** | Core Features | Main modules & UX flows complete | E2E tests pass |
| **Phase 3** | Integrations | External APIs, Auth, Services linked | Data validated |
| **Phase 4** | Polish & Deploy | QA, performance, production setup | Public launch stable |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Phase 1 ‚Äî Setup & Prototype
**Goal:** Establish project foundation.

**Tasks**
- [ ] Initialize repository and version control.
- [ ] Configure CI/CD pipeline.
- [ ] Set up frontend (Next.js + Tailwind) and backend (Node.js + Express).
- [ ] Add environment configuration and local `.env` template.
- [ ] Create first UI component and ensure end-to-end build.
- [ ] Document initial structure in `folder-structure.md`.

**Success Criteria**
- Project builds locally with no lint or build errors.
- Memory bank recognized and loaded correctly in Cursor.

---

## üß© 3. Phase 2 ‚Äî Core Features
**Goal:** Build the main functionality and core flows.

**Tasks**
- [ ] Implement main UI components (cards, modals, inputs).
- [ ] Create navigation and routing structure.
- [ ] Develop backend endpoints for main entities.
- [ ] Add input validation and testing coverage.
- [ ] Ensure responsive design and accessibility compliance.

**Success Criteria**
- All key flows (read, create, update) are functional.
- 80%+ test coverage on main modules.

---

## üîó 4. Phase 3 ‚Äî Integrations
**Goal:** Connect external systems and services.

**Tasks**
- [ ] Integrate authentication (JWT/session-based).
- [ ] Connect third-party APIs (if applicable).
- [ ] Implement service-level caching and monitoring.
- [ ] Validate data sync between frontend ‚Üî backend ‚Üî services.
- [ ] Update `architecture.md` with integration details.

**Success Criteria**
- All integrations tested and documented.
- Error handling consistent across services.

---

## üöÄ 5. Phase 4 ‚Äî Polish & Deploy
**Goal:** Finalize, optimize, and deploy to production.

**Tasks**
- [ ] Refine UI, animations, and micro-interactions.
- [ ] Run performance audits (Lighthouse, Web Vitals).
- [ ] Conduct full QA review and fix critical bugs.
- [ ] Deploy frontend (Vercel) and backend (Fly.io/Railway).
- [ ] Configure monitoring and alerting.
- [ ] Update all `.md` docs with post-launch info.

**Success Criteria**
- Live app is accessible and passes smoke tests.
- Monitoring dashboards active.

---

## üß≠ 6. Ongoing Maintenance
**Goal:** Keep the system stable and evolving post-deployment.

**Tasks**
- [ ] Track issues and prioritize fixes weekly.
- [ ] Review dependencies and upgrade quarterly.
- [ ] Measure metrics (uptime, latency, user feedback).
- [ ] Prepare next iteration roadmap.

**Success Criteria**
- No unresolved high-severity issues.
- System performance within SLA thresholds.

---

## üß† 7. Principles
- Keep each task **atomic and testable**.
- Prefer iteration over large refactors.
- Always document blockers inline.
- Avoid overlapping scopes between phases.

---

## ‚úÖ 8. Usage Notes
- Cursor should use this file to **sequence development actions** or plan tasks.
- When generating new work items, always map them to an existing phase.
- Never invent additional phases or project scopes.
