# Development Progress

This file tracks the evolution of the project across all development phases.  
It serves as the *single source of truth* for what is done, what is blocked, and what comes next.

---

## 🧱 1. Current Phase
| Phase | Status | Summary |
|--------|---------|----------|
| [Phase X] | [in-progress / completed / pending] | [Short description of goals and progress] |

**Example**
```
Phase 2 — Core Features  
Status: In Progress  
Summary: UI components and API routes are under validation; unit tests at 65%.
```

---

## 📋 2. Active Tasks
| Task | Owner | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|--------|
| Setup repository | DevOps | ✅ Done | Repo initialized, CI pipeline configured |
| Build prototype | Frontend | 🟡 In progress | UI base ready, waiting for API |
| Integrate API | Backend | ⏳ Pending | Auth and endpoints in progress |
| Finalize UI | Design | 🔜 Upcoming | Will start after API integration |

**Guidelines**
- Each task must belong to an existing phase.
- Keep status icons consistent (`✅`, `🟡`, `⏳`, `🔜`, `❌`).
- Add short, factual notes only — no speculation.

---

## 🚧 3. Blockers
| Category | Description | Owner | Resolution |
|-----------|--------------|--------|-------------|
| Infrastructure | Build failing on CI | DevOps | Fix workflow permissions |
| API | Rate-limit issue on staging | Backend | Waiting for provider fix |
| Design | Missing assets | Design | Pending delivery |

**Rules**
- Update blockers only if they impact delivery.
- Always specify the owner or responsible area.
- Remove resolved blockers once confirmed.

## 🎯 4. Next Steps
| Phase | Task | Priority | ETA |
|--------|------|-----------|------|
| 3 | Integrate auth API | High | 2025-11-05 |
| 3 | Deploy test environment | Medium | 2025-11-06 |
| 4 | QA + final polish | High | 2025-11-10 |

**Guidelines**
- Use short ETAs, not long-term projections.
- Keep the focus on the next milestone only.
- Avoid vague items like “Improve performance” — use measurable goals.

## 📈 5. Summary Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target | Notes |
|---------|----------|---------|--------|
| Test Coverage | 72% | 85% | Increasing steadily |
| Build Time | 42s | <30s | Optimizing CI cache |
